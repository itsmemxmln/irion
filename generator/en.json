Precision welding services are our core competence alongside CNC machining of steel and stainless steel. For more than 2 decades we have mastered the arc welding of steel and stainless steel with our high-end welding equipment from Cloos made in Germany!\r\nPrecision welding means more to us than just joining parts together. We take it to heart and push it to our limits every day. One focus of our work is in the area between additive manufacturing (3D printing) and steel casting. As your partner for welded assemblies, welded parts, welded structures and welded brackets, we manufacture repeatable and repetitive critical project series from 30 to several thousand pieces for you.\r\nMore than 20 highly motivated and certified welders are responsible for your demanding welded parts, brackets, welded structures, immovable (rigid) as well as movable (baffles, louvers, etc.). At Irion, we weld manually and piece-intensive welded assemblies robotically using high-tech robots with up to 9 interpolating axes.\r\nDimensions of our welded assemblies, weldments, welded structures and welded brackets are up to 8 m x 4 m x 2,5 m. We start with dimensions from 20 mm x 20 mm x 1 mm.\r\n\r\nMade in Germany and being competitive at the same time. This is made possible by computer controlled offline robot simulation of our trained and highly motivated staff. We are proud of our trainee quota of almost 15%. This is the only way we manage to counteract the shortage of skilled workers. Apprenticed professions that we offer in our company are industrial mechanic, metal cutting mechanic and specialist for metal professions, which also includes the apprenticed profession of welder.\r\nWe weld steel and stainless steel. Please feel free to contact us! We will respond to your requirements and support you in your project. Welding competence at Irion:\r\n• MAG welding of steel / stainless steel\r\n• MIG welding of steel / stainless steel\r\n• Robot welding with 6 axis welding robots / 7 axis welding robots / 8 axis welding robots / 9 axis welding robots\r\n• TIG welding of steel / stainless steel\r\n\r\nOur spectrum lies between single parts and long-time series. Critical masses are so-called project series, which are called off once and are manufactured repeatedly in quantities from 30 pieces up to 3.000 pieces and more in precise dimensions with deviations of 0,5 mm on lengths of up to 5 m. Welded skids (conveyor slides), welded machine frames, welded operating equipment, welded consoles for your machines, construction machinery, agricultural machinery, earthmoving machinery, lifting equipment such as cranes as well as painting aids such as cross beams, goods carriers, component carriers and much more in the world of welding and milled welding.\r\nA guarantor for your intelligent welding assembly is our expertise, based on years of experience, of anticipating the heat changes of welded components. We straighten cold or mechanically and hot or thermally. Preferably, we rely on our proven fixture construction, which is able to get your parts in the correct position after welding without further processing. In doing so, we manage to avoid cost-intensive post-processing by means of CNC.\r\nOur welding expertise is completed by experienced quality managers who use standard welding inspection procedures. We master validation processes of penetrant testing, optical testing (visual welding inspection process), in external execution also the X-ray welding inspection process and the ultrasonic welding inspection process to meet our and especially your maximum quality requirements.\r\n",

From the beginning of the 80s, the supply of the materials handling industry with components for their plants was added. Today, Irion serves customers from the automotive, construction, agricultural, cultural, logistics, medical and food technology sectors with demanding welding-milling combinations in quantities ranging from 30 to 1.000 pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nDue to a consistently high level of quality, professional order processing and on-time delivery, we are always the first choice for our customers compared to our competitors.\r\nAn excerpt from our customer list, which includes many companies of distinction, is available upon request.\r\n\r\nNumbers, data, facts\r\n\r\nCurrently Irion GmbH employs 40 motivated people in administration and production.
